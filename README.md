## General Considerations

1. Do Not Push to Main Branch:
- The main branch is the primary branch of the repository and should remain stable at all times. Avoid pushing directly to this branch to prevent conflicts and errors in the base code.
- Instead, all contributions and changes should be made through feature branches.

2. Use "Develop" Branch as the Most Updated:
- It is recommended to create and use a branch named develop as the main branch for ongoing development.
- This branch should always reflect the latest version of code being actively developed, integrating all new features and bug fixes.
- The develop branch serves as an integration point for features developed by different collaborators before merging into the main branch.
- Keeping the develop branch updated facilitates collaboration and reduces conflicts during the integration of changes.
